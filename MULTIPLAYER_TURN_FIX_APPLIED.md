# Multiplayer Turn Fix Applied

## Problem Resolved
Fixed the issue where multiplayer turns would get stuck when a player didn't take their turn, preventing the game from progressing.

## Root Cause
The `enableDiceSection()` function in `game.js` was only starting auto-action timers when it was the local player's turn. When it was another player's turn, no timer was started, causing the game to wait indefinitely if that player didn't act.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced `enableDiceSection()` Function
**Location**: `game.js` lines 14774-14781

**Change**: Added auto-action timer for remote players
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Start auto-action timer for current player even if it's not local player's turn
// This ensures turns advance automatically if the current player doesn't act
if (currentPlayer && !currentPlayer.isAI && !currentPlayer.bankrupt) {
    console.log(`[enableDiceSection] Starting auto-action timer for remote player: ${currentPlayer.name}`);
    startAutoActionTimer('roll');
    // Also start backup turn monitor
    startTurnMonitor();
}
```

### 2. Added Turn Monitoring System
**Location**: `game.js` lines 14491-14551

**Features**:
- **Primary Timer**: Uses existing `startAutoActionTimer('roll')` (15-20 seconds)
- **Backup Timer**: New `startTurnMonitor()` system (25 seconds)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Timers are cleared when turns change

**Functions Added**:
- `startTurnMonitor()` - Starts backup turn advancement timer
- `stopTurnMonitor()` - Cleans up turn monitor when turn changes

### 3. Enhanced `nextTurn()` Function
**Location**: `game.js` line 10436

**Change**: Added cleanup of turn monitor
```javascript
stopTurnMonitor(); // Stop turn monitor from previous turn
```

### 4. Debug Functions Added
**Location**: `game.js` lines 14846-14910

**Functions**:
- `window.forceNextTurn()` - Manually advance turn (console command)
- `window.checkTurnStatus()` - Check current turn state (console command)

## How It Works

### Normal Flow
1. When a player's turn begins, `enableDiceSection()` is called
2. Auto-action timer is started (15-20 seconds depending on action type)
3. Backup turn monitor is started (25 seconds)
4. If player acts normally, timers are cleared and turn proceeds
5. When turn changes, all timers are cleaned up

### Stuck Turn Recovery
1. If current player doesn't act within 15-20 seconds:
   - Primary auto-action timer triggers `executeMultiplayerAutoTurn()`
   - Turn is automatically advanced via `nextTurn()`

2. If primary timer fails, backup monitor triggers at 25 seconds:
   - Attempts `executeMultiplayerAutoTurn()`
   - Falls back to direct `nextTurn()` call if needed

### Manual Recovery
Players can use console commands if needed:
```javascript
// Check current turn status
checkTurnStatus()

// Manually force turn advancement
forceNextTurn()
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Turns advance automatically if players don't act
2. **Dual Protection**: Primary + backup timers ensure reliability
3. **Clean Cleanup**: All timers are properly cleared to prevent conflicts
4. **Debug Support**: Console functions for troubleshooting
5. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't affect existing single-player or AI functionality

## Testing

The fix has been integrated into the main `game.js` file and will:
- ✅ Start timers for both local and remote players
- ✅ Automatically advance stuck turns
- ✅ Clean up timers when turns change
- ✅ Provide manual recovery options
- ✅ Maintain existing game functionality

## Usage

The fix is now active in the game. No additional setup required. If turns still get stuck:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run `checkTurnStatus()` to see current state
3. Run `forceNextTurn()` to manually advance if needed

The fix ensures that multiplayer games will no longer get permanently stuck waiting for player actions.
