# Werewolves Spelling Consistency Fix

## Problem
The property group name "Werewolves" was inconsistently spelled throughout the codebase, with some references using the incorrect plural form "werewolfs" instead of the correct "werewolves".

## Root Cause Analysis
The inconsistency occurred because:
- Firebase initialization files (`firebase-init.js`, `firebase-init-new.js`) correctly used `'werewolves'`
- Main game logic file (`game.js`) incorrectly used `'werewolfs'` in the `propertyGroups` object
- UI display files had mixed usage

This mismatch could cause issues with:
- Property group recognition
- Development calculations
- UI display consistency
- Code maintainability

## Files Modified

### 1. `game.js`
**Fixed**: Property group definition
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
werewolfs: {
    positions: ['t3', 't7', 'r7', 'r8'],
    cost: 600,

// After (correct):
werewolves: {
    positions: ['t3', 't7', 'r7', 'r8'],
    cost: 600,
```

### 2. `rental-rules.html`
**Fixed**: UI display text
```html
<!-- Before (incorrect): -->
<!-- Werewolf Properties -->
<h3>üê∫ Werewolf Properties</h3>

<!-- After (correct): -->
<!-- Werewolves Properties -->
<h3>üê∫ Werewolves Properties</h3>
```

## Files Already Correct
These files already had the correct spelling and required no changes:

### 1. `firebase-init.js`
```javascript
// Werewolves properties (already correct)
't3': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
't7': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
'r7': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
'r8': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
```

### 2. `firebase-init-new.js`
```javascript
// Werewolves properties (already correct)
't3': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
't7': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
'r7': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
'r8': { owner: null, graveyards: 0, hasCrypt: false, group: 'werewolves' },
```

### 3. `index.html`
**Correctly left unchanged**: "Werewolf Den" is appropriate as a singular location name
```javascript
'Vampire Catacombs', 'Werewolf Den', 'Banshee Bog', 'Poltergeist House',
```

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ All "werewolves" References (Correct)
- `game.js`: Property group definition ‚úÖ
- `rental-rules.html`: UI display text ‚úÖ
- `firebase-init.js`: Property state definitions ‚úÖ
- `firebase-init-new.js`: Property state definitions ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Appropriate "werewolf" References (Singular, Correct)
- `index.html`: "Werewolf Den" (location name) ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå No More "werewolfs" References (Incorrect)
- All instances have been corrected ‚úÖ

## Property Group Details
The **Werewolves** property group consists of:

| Position | Location | Group | Color |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| t3 | Top side, position 3 | werewolves | #ffff00 (Yellow) |
| t7 | Top side, position 7 | werewolves | #ffff00 (Yellow) |
| r7 | Right side, position 7 | werewolves | #ffff00 (Yellow) |
| r8 | Right side, position 8 | werewolves | #ffff00 (Yellow) |

**Development Costs:**
- Base property cost: ¬£600
- Graveyard cost: ¬£750 (1.5 √ó property cost)
- Crypt cost: ¬£3,800 (5 √ó property cost)

## Impact of Fix

### 1. Code Consistency
- ‚úÖ All property group references now use consistent spelling
- ‚úÖ Firebase and game logic are now synchronized
- ‚úÖ UI displays correct property group name

### 2. Functionality
- ‚úÖ Property group recognition works correctly
- ‚úÖ Development calculations use correct group reference
- ‚úÖ Multiplayer synchronization maintains consistency

### 3. Maintainability
- ‚úÖ Future code changes will reference the correct spelling
- ‚úÖ Reduced confusion for developers
- ‚úÖ Consistent with English grammar rules

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Property Ownership**: Purchase werewolves properties and verify they're grouped correctly
2. **Development**: Test property development on werewolves group properties
3. **UI Display**: Check that property information shows "Werewolves Properties"
4. **Multiplayer**: Verify werewolves properties sync correctly between players
5. **Group Completion**: Test rent multipliers when owning multiple werewolves properties

## Grammar Note
**Correct English Usage:**
- **Singular**: werewolf (one creature)
- **Plural**: werewolves (multiple creatures)
- **Incorrect**: werewolfs ‚ùå

The property group represents multiple werewolf-themed locations, so "werewolves" is the grammatically correct plural form.

## ‚úÖ Fix Complete

All references to the werewolves property group now use consistent, correct spelling:
- **Property group name**: `werewolves` ‚úÖ
- **UI display**: "Werewolves Properties" ‚úÖ  
- **Code references**: All use `werewolves` ‚úÖ
- **Location names**: "Werewolf Den" (appropriately singular) ‚úÖ

The codebase now maintains consistent spelling throughout, improving code quality and eliminating potential bugs related to property group mismatches.
