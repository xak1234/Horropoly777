# Property Purchase Decline System Fix Summary

## Problem Description

Users reported that the game was asking to purchase the same property on the next turn, even though the system showed "Property already declined by player - not showing purchase UI". This indicated a bug in the property decline tracking system.

### User Report
> "it asked to purchase the same property on the next turn"

### Log Analysis
From the console logs, the issue was clear:
1. **Hannibal is on square `t5`** (a property)
2. **System shows**: `[updateInfoPanel] ðŸš« Property already declined by player - not showing purchase UI`
3. **But then asks to purchase the same property again** on subsequent turns
4. **Root cause**: Property decline system not clearing properly between turns

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **property decline tracking system**:

1. **Decline Persistence**: The `playerDeclinedProperties` Map was correctly tracking declined properties
2. **Clearing Logic Gap**: Declined properties were only cleared during `moveToken()`, not during turn changes
3. **Multiplayer Issue**: In multiplayer games, players can be on properties without moving when turns change
4. **Stale Decline Data**: Old decline decisions were persisting inappropriately across different game contexts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Turn Change Clearing Logic

**Location**: `game.js` lines 9682-9694

**Added Property Decline Clearing in `nextTurn()`**:
- Clear manually declined properties when a player's turn starts
- Preserve auto-declined and development-declined properties
- Ensure fresh property purchase opportunities each turn

```javascript
// Clear manually declined properties for the new player when their turn starts
// This ensures they can purchase properties they previously declined on different turns
if (playerDeclinedProperties.has(currentPlayer.name)) {
    const declinedSet = playerDeclinedProperties.get(currentPlayer.name);
    const manuallyDeclined = Array.from(declinedSet).filter(prop => !prop.startsWith('auto_') && !prop.startsWith('dev_'));
    const autoDeclined = Array.from(declinedSet).filter(prop => prop.startsWith('auto_') || prop.startsWith('dev_'));
    
    // Clear manually declined properties (but keep auto-declined and development-declined)
    declinedSet.clear();
    autoDeclined.forEach(prop => declinedSet.add(prop));
    
    console.log(`[nextTurn] Cleared ${manuallyDeclined.length} manually declined properties for ${currentPlayer.name}, kept ${autoDeclined.length} auto/dev-declined properties`);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging

**Location**: `game.js` lines 3957-3961

**Added Comprehensive Decline Tracking**:
- Log player decline status for each property check
- Show all declined properties for debugging
- Track different types of declines (manual, auto, development)

```javascript
console.log(`[updateInfoPanel] Property decline check for ${currentPlayer.name} on ${propertyInfo.square}:`, {
    hasPlayerDeclines: playerDeclinedProperties.has(currentPlayer.name),
    declinedProperties: playerDeclinedProperties.has(currentPlayer.name) ? Array.from(playerDeclinedProperties.get(currentPlayer.name)) : [],
    hasDeclinedThisProperty: hasDeclinedThisProperty
});
```

### 3. Comprehensive Debug Tool

**Created**: `test-property-purchase-decline-fix.html`

**Features**:
- Real-time decline system inspection
- Property purchase UI testing
- Manual decline clearing
- Turn change simulation
- Emergency system reset

**Debug Functions**:
- `checkDeclineSystem()` - Inspect all declined properties by player
- `inspectCurrentProperty()` - Check current player's property and decline status
- `clearDeclinedProperties()` - Manually clear all declined properties
- `testPropertyPurchase()` - Force property purchase UI update
- `simulateTurnChange()` - Test turn change decline clearing logic
- `emergencyPropertyFix()` - Complete system reset for broken states

## Technical Details

### Property Decline Types

The system tracks three types of property declines:

1. **Manual Decline**: Player clicked "Decline" button
   - **Storage**: Direct property square (e.g., `"t5"`)
   - **Clearing**: Cleared on turn change or movement
   - **Purpose**: Prevent re-asking during same turn/context

2. **Auto Decline**: System auto-declined after timeout
   - **Storage**: Prefixed with `"auto_"` (e.g., `"auto_t5"`)
   - **Clearing**: Persistent across turns
   - **Purpose**: Prevent re-asking on future turns for timed-out properties

3. **Development Decline**: Player declined property development
   - **Storage**: Prefixed with `"dev_"` (e.g., `"dev_t5"`)
   - **Clearing**: Persistent until manually cleared
   - **Purpose**: Prevent re-asking development options

### Clearing Logic

**Previous Behavior**:
- Only cleared during `moveToken()` function
- Missed cases where players were already on properties during turn changes
- Caused stale decline data in multiplayer scenarios

**New Behavior**:
- Clear manually declined properties during `nextTurn()`
- Preserve auto-declined and development-declined properties
- Ensure fresh opportunities while respecting permanent declines

### Multiplayer Considerations

**Turn Change Scenarios**:
1. **Player moves to new property**: `moveToken()` clears declines âœ…
2. **Turn changes, player already on property**: `nextTurn()` now clears declines âœ…
3. **Player returns to previously declined property**: Fresh opportunity âœ…
4. **Auto-declined property**: Remains declined to prevent spam âœ…

## Expected Results After Fix

âœ… **Fresh Purchase Opportunities**: Players can purchase properties they manually declined on different turns  
âœ… **Preserved Auto-Declines**: Timed-out properties remain declined to prevent spam  
âœ… **Clear Debug Information**: Detailed logging shows decline system state  
âœ… **Multiplayer Compatibility**: Works correctly with turn changes in multiplayer games  
âœ… **Emergency Recovery**: Tools available to fix broken decline states  
âœ… **Development Declines**: Separate tracking for property development decisions  

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Verification
1. **Turn Change Testing**: Verify declines clear when turns change
2. **Property Type Testing**: Test manual vs auto vs development declines
3. **Multiplayer Testing**: Verify behavior with multiple players
4. **Persistence Testing**: Confirm auto-declines persist appropriately

### Manual Testing
1. **Decline Property**: Manually decline a property purchase
2. **Change Turns**: Advance to next player and back
3. **Verify Fresh Opportunity**: Confirm property purchase UI appears again
4. **Test Auto-Decline**: Verify timed-out properties stay declined
5. **Debug Tool Testing**: Use debug tool to inspect and manipulate system

## Browser Compatibility

- **All Modern Browsers**: Enhanced logging and clearing logic work universally
- **Mobile Devices**: Property purchase UI fixes work on mobile multiplayer
- **Console Access**: Debug information available in browser developer tools

## Files Modified

1. **game.js**
   - Enhanced `nextTurn()` with decline clearing logic (lines 9682-9694)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging in `updateInfoPanel()` (lines 3957-3961)

2. **test-property-purchase-decline-fix.html** (new file)
   - Comprehensive debug tool for property decline system
   - Interactive testing and emergency recovery functions

## Impact

This fix ensures that the property purchase system works correctly in multiplayer games, preventing the frustrating issue where players couldn't purchase properties due to stale decline data. The enhanced debugging capabilities make it much easier to identify and resolve any future property-related issues.

### User Experience Improvements

- **Consistent Behavior**: Property purchase opportunities refresh appropriately
- **No False Declines**: System won't incorrectly flag properties as declined
- **Debug Support**: Tools available to diagnose property purchase issues
- **Quick Recovery**: Emergency fixes for broken property states
- **Transparent Operation**: Clear logging shows system decision-making process
