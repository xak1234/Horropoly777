# üöÄ Horropoly Multiplayer Sync - Deployment Checklist

## üìã Pre-Deployment Setup

### **1. Firebase Service Account**
- [ ] Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [ ] Select your `horropoly` project
- [ ] Navigate to **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Service Accounts**
- [ ] Click **Generate New Private Key**
- [ ] Download the JSON file
- [ ] Copy the entire JSON content (you'll need this for Render)

### **2. Update Firestore Rules**
- [ ] Copy the updated `firestore.rules` content
- [ ] Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Rules**
- [ ] Paste the new rules and click **Publish**
- [ ] Verify rules are active (may take 1-2 minutes)

### **3. Set Up Firebase Authentication**
Since the new rules require `request.auth != null`, you need to add authentication to your client:

```javascript
// Add to your client-side code
import { getAuth, signInAnonymously } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();

// Sign in anonymously when starting the game
async function initializeAuth() {
  try {
    await signInAnonymously(auth);
    console.log("‚úÖ Authenticated anonymously");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Authentication failed:", error);
  }
}

// Call this before any Firestore operations
await initializeAuth();
```

## üåê Render Deployment

### **Step 1: Create Render Account**
- [ ] Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Sign up/login with GitHub account
- [ ] Connect your repository

### **Step 2: Create Web Service**
- [ ] Click **New** ‚Üí **Web Service**
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository
- [ ] Choose the repository containing your backend code
- [ ] Configure the service:
  - **Name**: `horropoly-multiplayer-backend`
  - **Environment**: `Node`
  - **Build Command**: `npm install`
  - **Start Command**: `npm start`
  - **Plan**: `Starter` (free tier)

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**
In Render dashboard, go to **Environment** and add:

- **Key**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
- **Value**: `{"type":"service_account","project_id":"horropoly",...}` (paste your entire Firebase service account JSON)

- **Key**: `NODE_ENV`
- **Value**: `production`

### **Step 4: Deploy**
- [ ] Click **Create Web Service**
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Note your backend URL: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

### **Step 5: Test Backend**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "horropoly-multiplayer-sync-backend"
}
```

## üéÆ Client Integration

### **Step 1: Update Backend URL**
In `client-multiplayer-sync.js`, update:
```javascript
const BACKEND_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com';
```

### **Step 2: Add Authentication**
Add to your main game initialization:
```javascript
import { getAuth, signInAnonymously } from "firebase/auth";

async function initializeGame() {
  // Authenticate first
  const auth = getAuth();
  await signInAnonymously(auth);
  
  // Then initialize multiplayer sync
  await initializeMultiplayerSync(roomId, playerId);
}
```

### **Step 3: Update Game Functions**
Follow the [Game.js Integration Guide](./GAME_JS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) to:
- [ ] Replace direct Firestore writes with intent calls
- [ ] Update state subscription to use authoritative state
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add proper error handling

## üß™ Testing

### **Test 1: Single Player Actions**
- [ ] Roll dice - should update position
- [ ] Purchase property - should deduct money and assign ownership
- [ ] Develop property - should add graveyards/crypts
- [ ] End turn - should advance to next player

### **Test 2: Multiplayer Sync**
- [ ] Open game in two browser tabs/devices
- [ ] Player 1 rolls dice - Player 2 should see the update
- [ ] Player 2 purchases property - Player 1 should see ownership change
- [ ] Turn alternation should work correctly
- [ ] Both players should see consistent game state

### **Test 3: Error Handling**
- [ ] Try invalid actions (purchase with insufficient funds)
- [ ] Try out-of-turn actions
- [ ] Verify error messages are shown
- [ ] Verify game state remains consistent

### **Test 4: Network Issues**
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect internet during game
- [ ] Verify game state syncs correctly after reconnection
- [ ] Test with slow network connections

## üîç Monitoring

### **Backend Logs**
Monitor your Render service logs:
- [ ] Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí **Logs**
- [ ] Watch for intent processing messages
- [ ] Check for any error messages

### **Firebase Usage**
Monitor Firestore usage:
- [ ] Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí **Firestore** ‚Üí **Usage**
- [ ] Check read/write operations
- [ ] Monitor rule evaluations

### **Client Console**
Check browser console for:
- [ ] Authentication success messages
- [ ] State update messages
- [ ] Any error messages

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Permission denied" errors**
```
Solution: 
1. Verify Firestore rules are deployed
2. Check Firebase Auth is working (signInAnonymously)
3. Confirm user is authenticated before Firestore operations
```

#### **Backend not responding**
```
Solution:
1. Check Render service is running
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check service logs for errors
4. Test health endpoint
```

#### **CORS errors**
```
Solution:
1. Verify backend has CORS enabled
2. Check client domain is allowed
3. Ensure requests include proper headers
```

#### **State not syncing**
```
Solution:
1. Verify client is subscribed to correct path
2. Check backend is writing to state collection
3. Confirm Firebase rules allow reads
4. Check authentication status
```
