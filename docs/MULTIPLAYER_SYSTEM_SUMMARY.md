## Room Lifecycle Management

### Room Creation
1. Player creates room with activity timestamp

3. Auto-cleanup monitors room activity
4. Room is removed if inactive for 5+ minutes

### Room Joining
1. Players can view available rooms in real-time
2. Mobile-friendly input for entering player names
3. Duplicate player name prevention
4. Activity timestamp updated on join

### Room Cleanup
1. **Automatic cleanup every 2 minutes** removes:
   - Rooms inactive for 5+ minutes
   - Empty rooms
   - Finished/discarded games
   - Inactive players (5+ minutes no activity)

2. **Client-side filtering** hides stale rooms immediately
3. **Real-time updates** keep room list current

## Mobile Compatibility ✅

### Issues Fixed
- **Replaced `prompt()` with mobile-friendly modals**
- **Enhanced error handling** for mobile devices
- **Better room ID generation** to prevent invalid characters
- **Improved touch interface** with better button sizing

### Mobile Features
- **Touch-friendly input dialogs**
- **Responsive room list design**
- **Better error messages** for mobile users
- **Automatic retry logic** for failed operations

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Open test-multiplayer-system.html
# Click "Create Room" with different player names
# Verify rooms appear in available rooms list
# Wait 5+ minutes and verify rooms are cleaned up
```

### 2. Room Joining Test
```bash
# Create a room with Player1
# Open available_rooms.html
# Join the room with Player2
# Verify both players appear in room
```

### 3. Cleanup Test
```bash
# Create several test rooms
# Wait 5+ minutes without activity
# Run cleanup manually or wait for auto-cleanup
# Verify stale rooms are removed
```

### 4. Mobile Test
```bash
# Open available_rooms.html on mobile device
# Try creating and joining rooms
# Verify mobile input dialogs work properly
# Test error handling scenarios
```

## Configuration

### Cleanup Timing (Configurable in firebase-init.js)
```javascript
const staleThreshold = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes for unused rooms
const playerInactiveThreshold = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes for inactive players
```

### Auto-cleanup Interval (Configurable in available_rooms.html)
```javascript
setInterval(cleanupFunction, 2 * 60 * 1000); // Every 2 minutes
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Room count tracking** in available rooms display
- **Activity timestamps** for all rooms and players
- **Console logging** for all major operations
- **Error reporting** with detailed messages

### Debug Tools
- **System health checks** in test suite
- **Player status verification** across all rooms
- **Room activity monitoring** with timestamps
- **Manual cleanup triggers** for testing

## Security and Data Integrity

### Player Validation
- **Duplicate name prevention** within same room
- **Multiple room prevention** for single player
- **Input sanitization** for room and player names
- **Mobile-safe input handling**

### Room Validation
- **Unique room ID generation** with collision detection
- **Activity tracking** to prevent stale data
- **Automatic cleanup** to maintain database hygiene
- **Error boundaries** to prevent system crashes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Real-time player activity indicators**
2. **Room password protection**
3. **Advanced room filtering** (by player count, game type)
4. **Player reputation system**
5. **Room analytics dashboard**

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy loading** for large room lists
2. **Optimistic updates** for better responsiveness
3. **Connection pooling** for Firebase operations
4. **Client-side caching** for frequently accessed data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Rooms not appearing**: Check Firebase connection and console errors
2. **Mobile joining fails**: Clear browser cache and try mobile modal
3. **Cleanup not working**: Verify `cleanupStaleRooms` function import
4. **Duplicate players**: Check player name validation logic

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.testFirebaseConnection();
window.showAllPlayers();
window.cleanupStaleRooms();
window.checkPlayerStatus();
```
