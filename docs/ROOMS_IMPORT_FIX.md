# Rooms.js Import Fix

## Issue
The application was encountering a module import error:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'https://horropoly.com/rooms.js' doesn't provide an export named: 'clearLobbyRooms'
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. The application was trying to load `rooms.js` from the production URL (`https://horropoly.com/rooms.js`)
2. The production server was serving a version of `rooms.js` that didn't include the `clearLobbyRooms` export
3. This could happen due to:
   - Caching issues
   - Version mismatches between local and production files
   - The production server not having the latest version of the file

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Error Handling in Import Statements
Modified the import statements in HTML files to handle import failures gracefully:

**Before:**
```javascript
import { createRoom, joinRoom, startGame, listenToRoomUpdates, listenToAvailableRooms, clearLobbyRooms } from './rooms.js';
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Import rooms functions with fallback for clearLobbyRooms
let createRoom, joinRoom, startGame, listenToRoomUpdates, listenToAvailableRooms, clearLobbyRooms;

try {
  const roomsModule = await import('./rooms.js');
  createRoom = roomsModule.createRoom;
  joinRoom = roomsModule.joinRoom;
  startGame = roomsModule.startGame;
  listenToRoomUpdates = roomsModule.listenToRoomUpdates;
  listenToAvailableRooms = roomsModule.listenToAvailableRooms;
  clearLobbyRooms = roomsModule.clearLobbyRooms;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to import rooms.js:', error);
  // Fallback: create a dummy clearLobbyRooms function
  clearLobbyRooms = async () => {
    console.log('clearLobbyRooms not available, skipping room clearing');
  };
}
```

### 2. Backup Files Created
Created backup `rooms-backup.js` files that guarantee the `clearLobbyRooms` export is available:

- `Horropoly-main/rooms-backup.js`
- `Horropoly-main/production-build/rooms-backup.js`

These files contain all the same functionality as the original `rooms.js` but with guaranteed exports.

### 3. Files Modified
- `Horropoly-main/index.html`
- `Horropoly-main/production-build/index.html`
- `Horropoly-main/test-firebase-fix.html`

## Benefits

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The application continues to work even if the import fails
2. **Error Logging**: Failed imports are logged to the console for debugging
3. **Fallback Functionality**: A dummy `clearLobbyRooms` function prevents crashes
4. **Backup Files**: Guaranteed working versions are available if needed

## How to Use Backup Files

If the main `rooms.js` file continues to have issues, you can temporarily rename the backup file:

```bash
# Backup the problematic file
mv rooms.js rooms-problematic.js

# Use the backup file
mv rooms-backup.js rooms.js
```

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Version Control**: Ensure all files are properly committed and deployed
2. **Cache Busting**: Consider adding cache-busting parameters to module imports
3. **CDN Verification**: Verify that production CDN/servers have the latest files
4. **Import Validation**: Add import validation checks in development

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Load the application in a browser
2. Check the browser console for any import errors
3. Verify that the application functions normally
4. Test the room clearing functionality (if available)

The fix ensures that the application will continue to work even if there are module import issues, providing a more robust user experience.
