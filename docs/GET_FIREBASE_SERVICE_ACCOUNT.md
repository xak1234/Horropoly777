## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security
- **Keep this JSON file secure** - it contains sensitive credentials
- **Don't share it publicly** or commit it to public repositories
- **Only use it in your Render environment variables**

### Your Service Account Email
- **Your service account email should be:** `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@horropoly.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **If it's different, that's okay** - just make sure you're using the correct project

### Project ID
- **Your project ID should be:** `horropoly`
- **This confirms you're in the right project**

## üß™ Test After Setting

1. **Wait a few minutes** for Render to redeploy
2. **Test the backend:**
   ```bash
   curl https://horropoly-payment-backend.onrender.com/api/health
   ```
3. **Should return:**
   ```json
   {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-07-19T16:30:28.120Z"}
   ```

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue: "Generate new private key" button not visible
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're in the "Service accounts" tab
- Look for "Firebase Admin SDK" section
- If you don't see it, you might not have admin access to the project

### Issue: Downloaded file is empty or corrupted
**Solution:**
- Try downloading again
- Check your browser's download settings
- Make sure you have permission to download files

### Issue: JSON content is invalid
**Solution:**
- Make sure you copied the entire content
- Don't add extra quotes or characters
- Test the JSON in a JSON validator

### Issue: Service account email is different
**Solution:**
- That's okay! Use whatever email is in your downloaded JSON
- The important thing is that the project_id is "horropoly"

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you can't find the service account section:

1. **Make sure you're the owner** of the Firebase project
2. **Check if you have admin permissions**
3. **Try accessing Firebase Console in an incognito/private window**
4. **Make sure you're signed in with the correct Google account**
