# 🏠 Purchase Button Timing Fix Summary

## 🚨 Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Purchase Buttons Disappearing Too Quickly
**Problem**: Rosemary lands on properties but the purchase buttons disappear before she can click them.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[startAutoActionTimer] Starting 15-second timer for purchase action (multiplayer)
[clearAutoActionTimer] Auto-action timer cleared
💰 Showing purchase options for b6 to Rosemary (canAfford: true)
🚫 Clearing property info panel - shouldShowPropertyInfo=false
```

**Root Cause**: The purchase timer is being cleared immediately after being set, and the UI is being cleared by Firebase sync updates.

### Issue 2: Dice Timer Still 20 Seconds
**Problem**: Despite previous fixes, dice rolls still use 20-second timer.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[startAutoActionTimer] Starting 20-second timer for roll action (multiplayer)
```

**Root Cause**: Previous dice timing fixes weren't being applied properly or were being overridden.

### Issue 3: Purchase UI Getting Cleared by Firebase Sync
**Problem**: Firebase synchronization is clearing the purchase UI before players can make decisions.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
🔄 updateGameFromState called with: Object
🚨 No valid players found in game state. Rejecting update.
🚫 Clearing property info panel - shouldShowPropertyInfo=false
```

**Root Cause**: Firebase sync updates are triggering UI refreshes that clear purchase buttons.

```
